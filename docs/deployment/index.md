# Self-Hosting

You are encouraged to self-host an RSSerpent instance.

## Official Instances

RSSerpent has hosted some official instances. If you believe self-hosting is not a viable option for you, consider using one of the follows:

- <https://www.rsserpent.com>, hosted on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) [[source](https://github.com/RSSerpent/rsserpent-deploy-vercel)];
- <https://rsserpent.deta.dev>, hosted on [deta.sh](https://www.deta.sh/) [[source](https://github.com/RSSerpent/rsserpent-deploy-deta)];
- <https://rsserpent.herokuapp.com>, hosted on [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/) [[source](https://github.com/RSSerpent/rsserpent-deploy-heroku)];
